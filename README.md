Each keyword operation, will ask you various questions that will construct the file that you need.

This python script is generally used within Window Server operating systems or personal computers.

Possibly working on a Linux Port. Unknown, if that will come.

## Bugs & Suggestions
Go right ahead and post a bug, if there is a bug...
If you have a suggestion, please post one to the git repo.

## Pull Requests
I do not mind other creators putting in their own edits into the script, since I made this open-source. Furthermore, I will only accept pull requests at my own leisure. Therefore, don't spam me to get it integrated, otherwise, I'll just block you.
